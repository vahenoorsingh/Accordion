# Accordion
Created an accordion component using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Inspired from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/accordion)
# Features
When a user clicks on a question, its corresponding answer or content section will expand while collapsing any previously opened section. This allows only one section to be open at a time, keeping the UI clean and organized.
